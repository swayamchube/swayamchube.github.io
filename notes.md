## Notes 

These were taken as a course was going on (liveTeX'd if you will) and I never bothered correcting mistakes, so read them with caution. The notes on Analytic NT were not taken as part of a course and (hopefully) contain few mistakes. 

* Topology [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/research-interests/topology/main.pdf)  
* Measure Theory [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/research-interests/measure-theory/main.pdf)

## Blurbs and Expositions

### Commutative/Non-commutative Algebra 
* The Quillen-Suslin Theorem [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/math/quillen-suslin/main.pdf)
* PIDs that are not EDs [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/math/PID-not-ED/main.pdf)
* The Jacobson Radical [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/math/jacobson-radical/main.pdf)
* On $$\displaystyle\prod_{i = 1}^\infty\mathbb{Z}$$ [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/math/prod-z-not-free/main.pdf)
* Rings of Continuous Functions [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/math/rings-cts-functions/main.pdf) (<small>Most importantly, contains a discussion of the Krull dimension of $$C(X)$$ for a compact Hausdorff space $$X$$.</small>)
* Flat, Projective, and Injective Modules [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/math/free-proj-flat/main.pdf) (<small>This is a work in progress, and is not very well organized. Contains stuff about the interplay of flat and projective modules. Also contains a section on injective hulls and a nice application to Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein for injective modules. There's a section on the Eakin-Nagata theorem in there too for some reason.</small>)

### Group Theory
* Group Transfer [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/math/transfer/main.pdf)
* Subnormality in Group Theory [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/math/subnormality/main.pdf) (<small>The main goal of this was to write a self-contained exposition of Horosevskii's theorem. It also contains useful results on Sylow subgroups, Hall subgroups, nilpotent, and solvable groups.</small>)

### Lie Groups/Lie Algebras
* Theorems of Levi and Ado-Iwasawa [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/math/levi-ado-iwasawa/main.pdf)
* The Poincar√©-Birkhoff-Witt Theorem [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/math/pbw/main.pdf) (<small>Also contains a section on epimorphisms of Lie algebras.</small>)

### Analysis
* The Picard Theorems [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/math/picard/main.pdf)
* Lebesgue Differentiation [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/math/lebesgue-differentiation/main.pdf)
* The Inverse Galois Problem over $$\mathbb{C}(t)$$ [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/math/igp-ct/main.pdf)
