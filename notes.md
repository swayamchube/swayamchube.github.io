## Notes 

These were taken as a course was going on (liveTeX'd if you will) and I never bothered correcting mistakes, so read them with caution. The notes on Analytic NT were not taken as part of a course and (hopefully) contain few mistakes. 

* Topology [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/research-interests/topology/main.pdf)  
* Measure Theory [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/research-interests/measure-theory/main.pdf)

* Theorems of Levi and Ado-Iwasawa [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/math/levi-ado-iwasawa/main.pdf)
* The Poincaré-Birkhoff-Witt Theorem [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/math/pbw/main.pdf) (<small>Also contains a section on epimorphisms of Lie algebras.</small>)
* Group Transfer [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/math/transfer/main.pdf)
* The Inverse Galois Problem over $$\mathbb{C}(t)$$ [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/math/igp-ct/main.pdf)
* The Jacobson Radical [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/math/jacobson-radical/main.pdf)
* On $$\displaystyle\prod_{i = 1}^\infty\mathbb{Z}$$ [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/math/prod-z-not-free/main.pdf)
* Rings of Continuous Functions [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/math/rings-cts-functions/main.pdf) (<small>Most importantly, contains a discussion of the Krull dimension of $$C(X)$$ for a compact Hausdorff space $$X$$.</small>)
* Flat, Projective, and Injective Modules [PDF](https://swayamchube.github.io/math/free-proj-flat/main.pdf) (<small>This is a work in progress, and is not very well organized. Contains stuff about the interplay of flat and projective modules. Also contains a section on injective hulls and a nice application to Cantor-Schroeder-Bernstein for injective modules. There's a section on the Eakin-Nagata theorem in there too for some reason.</small>)
